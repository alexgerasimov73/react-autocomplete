# README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is the basic part of the component with auto-complete. For a better user experience it needs to finalize the following parts:

- clean button for the input;
- supporting label for the Input, icons, infinity load, and others;
- better realization of styles;
- component can have multi-select selections;
- some tests.

## Demo
